# Image-Denoising-with-Deep-Learning-Autoencoder


This project focuses on building and modifying a convolutional autoencoder to remove noise from images. Since the dataset does not contain noisy images, artificial noise is generated using Gaussian distribution before training. The workflow includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, building a baseline autoencoder model, modifying the architecture for improved performance, and evaluating results using MSE and SSIM metrics. The final outcome demonstrates how autoencoders can effectively restore image quality by reducing noise.
